![Finished version of programmable light controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/dilshan/programmable-light/images/prog-light-small.png)
Programmable light is a low cost and easy to build LED light controller. The main objective of this project is to design a maintenance free light which automatically on and off at the predetermined time of the day.

This light controller is based on *ATmega8* microcontroller and *DS1307* real time clock. It is designed to handle commonly available 24V - 7W LED modules. 

This project is an open design. All the design files, documentation, firmware source code are available to download at the [project source repository](https://github.com/dilshan/programmable-light).
