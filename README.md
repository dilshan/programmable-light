![Finished version of programmable light controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/dilshan/programmable-light/images/prog-light-small.png)
Programmable light is a low cost and easy to build LED light controller. The main objective of this project is to design a maintenance free light which automatically on and off at the predetermined time of the day.

This light controller is based on *ATmega8* microcontroller and *DS1307* real time clock. It is designed to handle commonly available 24V - 7W LED modules. 

This is [certified open source hardware project](https://certification.oshwa.org/lk000002.html).
